# MicroserviceTemplate1
This is a visual studio template for a microservices architecture which connecs an aspnetcorewebapi with mssql, redis and rabbitmq.

The goal is to use this as a starter template with all the necessary code and packages added to start development.

It will also have docker-compose files for local development, kubernetes yml files for local testing and terraforma files for deployment to aws, azure and gcp.

This is the goal of the template.
